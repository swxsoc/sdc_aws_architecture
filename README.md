# SDC AWS Pipeline Architecture

This repository contains Terraform configurations for managing AWS infrastructure across multiple missions, with separate environments for development and production.

## Infrastructure Management

### Base Infrastructure
- Managed in `base-infrastructure-terraform/`
- Uses default Terraform workspace
- Contains shared resources used across all pipelines
- Key components:
  - Base AWS infrastructure setup
  - Executor Lambda function
  - Common configuration in `swxsoc.auto.tfvars`

### Pipeline Infrastructure
- Managed in `pipeline-infrastructure-terraform/`
- Uses separate workspaces for each mission's environments
- Two workspaces per mission: development (dev) and production (prod)
- Components:
  - Mission-specific configurations (`hermes.tfvars`, `padre.tfvars`)
  - Lambda functions for artifacts, processing, and sorting
  - Pipeline-specific infrastructure
  - New general pipeline config: `swxsoc_pipeline.tfvars` (REACH as the first instrument, mission name `swxsoc_pipeline`)

## Getting Started

1. Install prerequisites:
   - Terraform
   - AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials

2. Base Infrastructure Deployment:
```bash
cd base-infrastructure-terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

3. Pipeline Infrastructure Deployment:
```bash
cd pipeline-infrastructure-terraform
terraform workspace select <environment>-<mission>
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file=<mission>.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=<mission>.tfvars
```

### swxsoc_pipeline Notes
- `swxsoc_pipeline.tfvars` uses mission-scoped names and starts with `instrument_names = ["reach"]` and `mission_name = "swxsoc_pipeline"`.
- Lambda creation is gated by `enable_*_lambda` flags so the first apply can succeed before images are pushed. Set these to `true` after the ECR images exist.
- Grafana credentials are optional for `swxsoc_pipeline` (`enable_grafana_secret = false` by default). Enable it only after the secret exists.
- Lambda VPC subnets and RDS ingress allowlists are configurable via tfvars to avoid hard-coded IDs when needed.
